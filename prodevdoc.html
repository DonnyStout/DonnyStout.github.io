  <h3>C:/Elevator/Pitch</h3>
  <p>Hello my name is Donny, I believe people should do what they are passionate about and I am
    passionate about game design and network/cyber security. I am learning programming so that I can build programs
    that make people safer and more secure in their lives and make games that they can enjoy. I would love to
    merge both because I believe that it can get more people interested in network security, does that interest you?

  <h3>C:/Reflections/Online/Presence</h3>
  <p>
    After thinking on how I want my to be presented online professionally, I think keeping my two passions separated would not only be too difficult
    but would also be dishonest. I do however think that presenting both in a professional manner and possibly finding a way that they could intersect
    could be quite beneficial.

  <h3>C:/Week2/Reflections</h3>
  <p>
    Glad that week 2 is over, feels like it has already been a month but
    this week was <i>much</i> easier than week 1, but still a lot of work ahead.
    I'm finding certain techniques that help with remembering the material and the introduction
    of discussions of new concepts is <i>extremely helpful</i>. I'm excited for that we will start
    working on our projects this week and start working with user interfaces.
  </p>

  <h3>C:/Week3/Reflections</h3>
  <p>
    Now that we have come to the end of Week 3 and the beginning of Week 4, it certainly feels that while it has only been a month,
    that we have been here much longer than a month but that it has also gone by so quickly. Though it has sucked to have lost a couple
    in the group it feels like the group that is left is pretty tight knit and with that being the case it feels like it helps us build better
    relationships within the group. It is disapointing that we may all only work on one capstone as a group but at least working together it
    should turn out amazing, so I'm looking forward to seeing what we as a group decide to do as our capstone project.
  </p>

<h3>C:/Week4/Reflections</h3>
<p>
  After our practical exam, actually trying to utilize what we have learned up to this point was interesting
  it helped pinpoint where I am and what I need to work on.
</p>

<h3>C:/Week5/Reflections</h3>
<p>
  Now that we have chosen capstone projects and will start working on our personal android projects.
  I am really excited to see where it goes and what I am able to do with my own project and also to see
  what working in a group on a full project is like and the differences between working solo and working
  with a group on a project and experiencing both.

</p>

<h3>C:/Week6/Reflections</h3>
<p>
  Now that we have started working on our projects and I amtrying to figure things out on my own I am learning how to adjust
  and trying not to ask for as much help. I feel I understand databases to a better degree now as that has been what
  most of my work has been on. Head down work has been an interesting contrast to what we have done up til this point and I'm still adjusting.

</p>


<h3>C:/Reflections/Team/Building</h3>
<p>
  Played Forbidden Island as a team building exercise with my capstone team. I was tasked with reading the rules and trying
  to understand the game which took a while but once I finally got a basic grasp of the game we began. We discussed our strategies
  as we played, we were faced with some disagreements but we were able to resolve them pretty quickly. We were able to get the first
  couple goals fairly easily but once the game got more difficult we all strategized together and were able to overcome the
  challenges that we faced and we won. I already knew my team fairly well and I don't feel as if anything really changed. We
  had already found easy ways to discuss things through and how to work as a team and I feel the exercise confirmed this.
